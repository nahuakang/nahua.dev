# New Blog

This is a temporary repository for my upcoming blog. It is built with Zola, a static site generator written in Rust.

To check out this blog locally, first install Zola:

```
# OS X
$ brew install zola

# Ubuntu
$ snap install --edge zola
```

Then, download the repository and get into the directory:

```
# SSH version
$ git clone git@github.com:nahuakang/zola-blog.git

# HTTP version
$ git clone https://github.com/nahuakang/zola-blog.git

$ cd zola-blog
```

Once inside the directory, do:

```
$ zola build && zola serve
```

Enjoy.
