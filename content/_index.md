## Howdy! This is Nahua

I am a **purpose-driven** software engineer and writer with an [unconventional path to programming](https://www.nahua.dev/posts/my-path-to-programming/). I am passionate about open source software and have contributed to open source projects such as [Rust Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) and [OpenMined](https://www.openmined.org/). Currently I am contributing to [SeaORM](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm) and [shuttle](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle). I'm interested in and hope to contribute to [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum).

Besides, I am a mentor and contributor to [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) for the [Rust](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust) and [Go](https://exercism.org/tracks/go) tracks. I help students improve their understandings of the languages as well as design and improve educational content and exercises.

## Programming story

When I was 16, I tried `Turbo Pascal` in a crash course session at my high
school. I did not know that most other students in the session had
already learned programming one way or another, so I felt stupid and was
scared out of ever touching a DOS again.

About 10 years later, over a coffee in a mountaineous town in
Switzerland, a kind and friendly value investor softly rejected my
proposal to do an internship at his investment fund. Instead, he recommended me
to learn Python for machine learning.

I was shocked. Never did I imagine that my life would have gone a full circle
to come back to a subject that haunted me a decade ago. I went to sleep feeling
defeated.

The next morning, having woken up and found an online tutorial for Python,
I bit my teeth and gave it a try.

The rest is history.
