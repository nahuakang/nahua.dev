Howdy! This is Nahua, a Renaissance human with an
[unconventional path to programming](./blog/my-path-to-programming/).

I am passionate about open source software and
have previously contributed to open source projects
such as [OpenMined](https://www.openmined.org/) and [Exercism](https://exercism.org/).

Most recently I have contributed to [Rust Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy),
[SeaORM](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm), [shuttle](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle),
as well as [V](https://github.com/vlang/v).

## Programming story

When I was 16, I read Eric S. Raymond's [How to be a hacker](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html) and tried Turbo Pascal in a crash course session at my high school. It made me feel stupid and I gave up quickly.

About 10 years later, over a coffee in a mountaineous town in
Switzerland, a kind and friendly value investor softly rejected my internship application to his investment fund. Instead, he recommended me to learn Python.

I was shocked. Never did I imagine that my life would have gone a full circle to come back to a subject that haunted me a decade before. I went to sleep feeling hopeless and defeated.

The next morning, having woken up and found an online tutorial for Python,
I bit my teeth and gave it a try.

The rest is history.
