Howdy! Nahua here.

I am a **purpose-driven** software engineer and writer with an [unconventional path to programming](https://www.nahua.dev/posts/my-path-to-programming/). I am passionate about open source software and have contributed to open source projects such as [Rust Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) and [OpenMined](https://www.openmined.org/). Currently I am contributing to [SeaORM](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm) and [shuttle](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle). I'm interested in and hope to contribute to [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum).

Besides, I am a mentor and contributor to [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) for the [Rust](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust) and [Go](https://exercism.org/tracks/go) tracks. I help students improve their understandings of the languages as well as design and improve educational content and exercises.

❤️ [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) 🦀, [Python](https://www.python.org/) 🐍 and [Go](https://go.dev/) 🐭

## This blog

I write this blog in an attempt to understand the concepts and things I learn
every day:

> See that bird? It’s a brown-throated thrush, but in Germany it’s called a halzenfugel, and in Chinese they call it a chung ling and even if you know all those names for it, you still know nothing about the bird. You only know something about people; what they call the bird. Now that thrush sings, and teaches its young to fly, and flies so many miles away during the summer across the country, and nobody knows how it finds its way.

## Programming story

When I was 16, I tried `Turbo Pascal` in a crash course session at my high
school. I did not know that most other students in the session had
already learned programming one way or another, so I felt stupid and was
scared out of ever touching a DOS again.

About 10 years later, over a coffee in a mountaineous town in
Switzerland, a kind and friendly value investor softly rejected my
proposal to do an internship at his investment fund. Instead, he recommended me
to learn Python for machine learning.

I was shocked. Never did I imagine that my life would have gone a full circle
to come back to a subject that haunted me a decade ago. I went to sleep feeling
defeated.

The next morning, having woken up and found an online tutorial for Python,
I bit my teeth and gave it a try.

The rest is history.
