## This blog
My personal hero, Richard Feynman, knew that knowing the name of
something is different from knowing that thing. This blog is the
documentation of my personal struggle in learning new programming
languages and tools so that I, and perhaps you, will understand it and
explain it to a 6-year-old with ease.

## Skills
I am proficient in `Python` and have good working knowledge of `Javascript` and `Go`. 

In terms of libraries, I am familiar with `PyTorch`, `Keras`, `Numpy`, `Flask`, and some Go web programming packages. Previously I dabbed into `Django` and `Rails` but do not use them at the moment.

Tools-wise, I have a decent command of `Git` and `Docker`.

## Who am I
I was born and raised in China but have the privilege of choosing where
in the world I want to live and what kind of values I want to
identify with.

I speak fluent English and Mandarin Chinese. My German is currently at
level C1 and I work on improving my spoken German further.

## Formal education
My formal education constituted a bachelor's degree in history from
Texas A&M University and a master's degree in international business from Stockholm School of Economics.

## Programming story
When I was 16, I tried Turbo Pascal in a crash course session at my high
school. I did not know that most other students in the session had
already learned programming one way or another, so I felt stupid and was
scared out of ever touching a DOS again.

About 10 years later, over a coffee in a mountaineous town in
Switzerland, a kind and friendly value investor softly rejected my 
proposal to do an internship at his investment fund. Instead, he recommended me
to learn Python for machine learning.

I was shocked. Never did I imagine that my life would have gone a full circle
to come back to a subject that haunted me a decade ago. I went to sleep feeling
defeated.

The next morning, having woken up and found an online tutorial for Python,
I bit my teeth and gave it a try.

The rest is history.

history, politics, leadership, or classical music, feel free to [reach
out to me][1]; I will try and respond within a few days.
