## This blog
I write this blog in an attempt to understand the concepts and things I learn
every day:
> See that bird? It’s a brown-throated thrush, but in Germany it’s called a halzenfugel, and in Chinese they call it a chung ling and even if you know all those names for it, you still know nothing about the bird. You only know something about people; what they call the bird. Now that thrush sings, and teaches its young to fly, and flies so many miles away during the summer across the country, and nobody knows how it finds its way.
> - Richard P. Feynman, *"What Do You Care What Other People Think?"*

## Who am I
I am a software engineer and open source enthusiast living in Berlin.
My formal education included a B.A. in history and a M.Sc. in management.
I developed a passion for all things programming in 2016 and have been
tinkering ever since.

I strongly believe in the tremendous potential for growth in each human.
However, while programmers are gifted with the *magical* power to
empower others to realize their potential, our industry has deviated from
this noble cause and unleashed *dark magic* that glued people's fingers
and faces to screens while polaorizing people's opinions of reality.

This is why I am passionate about privacy-preserving AI, a cleaner Internet,
and software applications that solve real problems and empower each and
every individual to become a better version of themselves.

## Skills
I am constantly aquiring new skills. Below are some of the languages, frameworks, and tools
that I have used or tinkered with.

**Programming Languages**:
`Python`, `Rust`, `Go`, `Javascript`, `Swift`, and `SQL`.

**Libraries and Frameworks**:
`Flask`, `Django`, `PostgreSQL`, `PyTorch`, `TensorFlow`, `gorilla/mux`, `pandas`, `NumPy`. 

**Development Tools**:
`Git`, `Bash/Zsh`, `Docker`, `Emacs`, `Vim`.

## Programming story
When I was 16, I tried `Turbo Pascal` in a crash course session at my high
school. I did not know that most other students in the session had
already learned programming one way or another, so I felt stupid and was
scared out of ever touching a DOS again.

About 10 years later, over a coffee in a mountaineous town in
Switzerland, a kind and friendly value investor softly rejected my 
proposal to do an internship at his investment fund. Instead, he recommended me
to learn Python for machine learning.

I was shocked. Never did I imagine that my life would have gone a full circle
to come back to a subject that haunted me a decade ago. I went to sleep feeling
defeated.

The next morning, having woken up and found an online tutorial for Python,
I bit my teeth and gave it a try.

The rest is history.
