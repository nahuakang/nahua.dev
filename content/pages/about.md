## Howdy! This is Nahua

I am a **purpose-driven** software engineer and writer with an [unconventional path to programming](https://www.nahua.dev/posts/my-path-to-programming/). I am passionate about open source software and have previously contributed to open source projects such as [OpenMined](https://www.openmined.org/) and [Exercism](https://exercism.org/).

Currently I am contributing to [Rust Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy), [SeaORM](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm), and [shuttle](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle). I'm interested in and hope to contribute to [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum).

## Programming story

When I was 16, I read Eric S. Raymond's [How to be a hacker](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html) and tried `Turbo Pascal` in a crash course session at my high school. It made me feel stupid and I gave up quickly.

About 10 years later, over a coffee in a mountaineous town in
Switzerland, a kind and friendly value investor softly rejected my internship application to his investment fund. Instead, he recommended me to learn Python.

I was shocked. Never did I imagine that my life would have gone a full circle to come back to a subject that haunted me a decade ago. I went to sleep feeling defeated.

The next morning, having woken up and found an online tutorial for Python,
I bit my teeth and gave it a try.

The rest is history.
