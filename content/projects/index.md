## Professional Work

Currently I work as a software engineer for [Twenty Billion Neurons](https://20bn.com/). My day-to-day role is using Python to implement the "logical functionality" of the brain of a deep-learning-powered [virtual fitness trainer Ally](https://fitnessallyapp.com/). Download the app in App Store, it's amazing and I use it 3-4 times every week!

## Open Source Projects
### OpenMined
I am a firm believer in open source software. As of now, I devote my spare time to contribute to [OpenMined](https://www.openmined.org/), the privacy-preserving AI project that aims to unlock the power of deep learning and data while respecting the privacy for each individual. My roles include:
- Contributor to [PySyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft)
- Contributor to [PyGrid](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyGrid)
- Contributor to [Syft.JS](https://github.com/OpenMined/syft.js)
- Editor of OpenMined's amazing Writing Team ([read our blogs](https://blog.openmined.org/))
- Member of OpenMined's Bootcamp Tech Team

### Sense
I also contribute to TwentyBN's open source project [Sense](https://github.com/TwentyBN/sense),
which enhances software applications with the ability to see and interact with humans using
nothing but an RGB camera.

### Rust-Clippy and Veloren
At present, I am also looking into [Rust-Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy),
a lint crate for the Rust language, as well as [Veloren](https://gitlab.com/veloren/veloren),
a voxel RPG game written in Rust.

## Deep Learning
Previously, I have completed Udacity's Nanodegree Foundation in Deep
Learning.
