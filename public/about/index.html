<p>Howdy! This is Nahua, a Renaissance human with an <a href="https://www.nahua.dev/posts/my-path-to-programming/">unconventional path to programming</a>.</p>
<p>I am passionate about open source software and have previously contributed to open source projects such as <a href="https://www.openmined.org/">OpenMined</a> and <a href="https://exercism.org/">Exercism</a>.</p>
<p>Currently I am contributing to <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy">Rust Clippy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm">SeaORM</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle">shuttle</a>. I'm interested in and hope to contribute to <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum">axum</a>.</p>
<h2 id="programming-story">Programming story</h2>
<p>When I was 16, I read Eric S. Raymond's <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">How to be a hacker</a> and tried <code>Turbo Pascal</code> in a crash course session at my high school. It made me feel stupid and I gave up quickly.</p>
<p>About 10 years later, over a coffee in a mountaineous town in
Switzerland, a kind and friendly value investor softly rejected my internship application to his investment fund. Instead, he recommended me to learn Python.</p>
<p>I was shocked. Never did I imagine that my life would have gone a full circle to come back to a subject that haunted me a decade before. I went to sleep feeling hopeless and defeated.</p>
<p>The next morning, having woken up and found an online tutorial for Python,
I bit my teeth and gave it a try.</p>
<p>The rest is history.</p>
