It is written in self-reflection as well as self-meditation for a small circle of friends and acquaintances. Should you, a dear stranger, find any inspiration or consolation in my writing, I would feel a great sense of joy and achievement.\n\nI am writing this not for the eyes of the many, but for yours alone: for each of us is audience enough for the other.\n-- Epicurus\n\nTL;DR\nIt is challenging to start a career in software engineering without a background in a related university degree. It is certainly a rewarding path but, like my story suggests, we must have the conviction to work extremely hard, learn every day, set the right expectations, and continue re-making ourselves so that we could capture an opportunity when luck befalls on us. No matter what kind of career pivots we want to make, the key to success is to find the sweet spot between our passion and market demands through continuous learning and a lot of trials and errors.\n\nThanks to Silicon Valley, software engineering is one of the most (excessively) glorified lines of work in the 21st century. More and more people every day are curious about entering software from other fields.\nI started programming in April, 2016. I began my software internship in April 2020. In July, 2020, I officially became a junior software engineer and joined the ranks of life-long learners who play and toil in one of the most dynamic, ever-changing fields.\nThis blog post is written mostly for myself. With feedback from my closest friends, I hope it represents a sincere, candid account of all the failures I faced, the right actions I took, as well as the personality I display in my pursuit to find career fulfillment.\nIf there were any external motivations for this post, then it would be to share my conviction that, regardless of what career you are interested in, learning how to remake our self by acquiring knowledge in unfamiliar territory and picking up new skills on the fly is one of the most essential skills we should learn today.\nIn another word, embrace knowledge that you are curious about, whether you studied it for your degree or not.\nBack to the Origin\nMy story began in the fall of 2006 when I entered one of the most prestigious high schools in Fujian, China with flying marks. In my city's annual high school entrance exam, I ranked as the top student in my middle school and among the top 30 best students. My blood was pumped with confidence and I felt I was a smart cookie destined for greatness.\n\n  \n  \n    Hackers &amp; Painters\n  \n\nAround this time, I developed an admiration for hackers after reading the Chinese translation of Eric S. Raymond's blog post, How to Become a Hacker and a few poorly translated chapters of Paul Graham's Hackers and Painters. A hacker's personality and character, as revealed by Raymond and Graham's writings, as well as the meritocratic nature of hacker communities deeply resonated with the yet-to-be-developed values I had. (Note: Steven Levy's Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution is a great book that I only encountered over a decade later.).\nWith encouragement from my high school best friend who knew programming already, I signed up for a weekend Pascal crash course offered by my high school. As I entered a room full of blue DOS screens on a fateful, humid Saturday morning, I was frightened.\nHaving grown up in a family that did not allow much time to play on a computer, I could not even type properly with five fingers at that time, not to mention using a DOS and writing if-else statements or for-loops in a dreadful language called Turbo Pascal! What's worse was that everyone except me seemed to be able to follow the pace of the crash course!\n\n  \n  \n    Turbo Pascal DOS Interface\n  \n\nFor some reason, staring at that blue screen, I could not understand how a computer thinks. Nor could I write down any line of code to perform more than a standard:\nprogram Hello;\nbegin\n  writeln ('Hello, world.');\nend\n\nI felt nervous, my head sweating. The teacher asked us to solve some more basic problems, but my brain felt like a overcooked pot of porridge. I sat there, stupified and petrified, while all the other students coded away, sharing their excitement with each other.\nBy lunch break, I sneaked out of the classroom and went home. I felt awfully stupid among some of the best students in my city.\nIn the subsequent weeks, I tried Java, C, and C++, languages my cousin was learning for his CS program at a university. Yet each time I did not know even how to install the software for these languages on my father's Windows PC. I tried writing code on paper, but even the simplest #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; seemed way too complicated for me, not to mention the verbose Java.\nAnd then, sometime sooner or later, I gave up and concluded that I was not made for programming. From that moment on, programming became a painful reminder of that awkward, humiliating morning and my fragile ego could not allow the acknowledgement that I was not as smart as I thought.\nHow I Started Learning Python\nFast forward to a decade later in 2016, I had already completed a BA in history from Texas A&amp;M, with the prestigious magna cum laude and the key to Phi Beta Kappa honor society under my belt. Having no idea what to do with my life and with an aversion of preparing for the Law School Admission Test (LSAT), I was pursuing bachelor's studies in a prestigious business school in St. Gallen, Switzerland.\nThere, in that beautiful little Swiss town, I entered the most trying two years of my life. While my classmates were scoring interviews with the likes of UBS, Goldman Sachs, and McKinsey, I could not get a business internship either in Switzerland or Germany. In fact, from the numerous applications I sent out, I got only one interview and the company took the other candidate.\nNowhere. Stuck. I knew I missed something, but I could not tell what it was. Having been a star at Texas A&amp;M, I felt like a complete loser in Switzerland.\nOut of sheer luck, I got in touch with a Frankfurt-based value investor, an alumnus who was kind enough to offer me some time to chat. We had a pleasant conversation over coffee in St. Gallen's Altstadt, during which, however, he quickly determined that I lacked all the necessary financial and accounting knowledge to work as an intern for his fund.\nSensing his acute yet accurate judgement, I asked out of desperation: \"What kind of skills should I learn that would be valuable to your fund?\"\nHe replied: \"You could consider learning Python and programming for machine learning. Technology is coming into value investing as well now.\"\nI felt a knot in my stomach tying up instantly. Words could not describe my frustration and disappointment as I walked home. I called my girlfriend at the time with tears in my eyes, whining to her that the last thing in the world I would want to do is learning how to program again and this investor literally just told me I should learn Python for programming. Beaten and defeated, I went to bed early that day but could not fall asleep.\n\n  \n  \n    In Cafe Roggwiller, I sat with a kind investor in the middle lounge in the back of this photo when he told me to learn programming. I remember vividly how fear arose in me as I heard his advice.\n  \n\nThe next morning, still with cloud in my mind, I bit my teeth and searched for online courses that would teach me Python. I found a few free resources, managed to install Python on my Windows laptop, and started programming.\nImmediately, I realized that something was different: I did not feel dumbfounded like I felt with Pascal, C or C++. There was no mysterious, magical, scret code flying around the text editor. It was simple. My hello world program (in Python2 syntax) was 1 line:\nprint \"Hello, world.\"\n\nWith still a lot of uncertainty and fear in me, I told myself that this time, I might actually get somewhere with Python. And that was the true story to how I started programming.\nCoding More and Encountering Deep Learning\nI would like to sincerely thank Guido van Rossum and all the core Python developers because they created a beautiful language that is inviting to those of us who are frightened by C++.\nAfter learning basic Python syntax and some programming concepts with the online book Learn Python the Hard Way and Coursera's Python for Everybody, I gained some confidence in programming. I switched my operating system from Windows to Ubuntu, a popular distro of Linux, as a gesture of committing to coding as a lifestyle.\nI didn't fall in love with programming yet. Sometimes, when I encountered a new concept that I could not understand, my fear of computer from 2006 would arise again and I had to give myself time to calm down and get back at the computer screen.\nBut for a student who felt stuck in his self-pity and stagnated career path, programming was weirdly liberating. And so, even making a useless, buggy text-based game in the terminal was a lovely distraction for me from the boring Economics exams that I had to memorize for.\nWithout any deliberate purpose, I learned more and more, such as how to dual boot Ubuntu and Windows, how to use the terminal and commandline, and how to write a small script to scrap search results from YouTube and download YouTube videos. The more I wrote, the more fun programming became. I knew no one would use any of the programs I wrote, but I was proud of them anyways.\nBy the fall of 2016, I made a calculated move of not completing my studies in St. Gallen but instead began my master's studies in Stockholm School of Economics. On the one hand, I wanted to close a long-distance relationship, on the other, I hoped that Scandinavia might offer opportunities to my stagnated career development.\nBeing the only student in my program who could script in a general-purpose programming language, I went deeper and deeper into it. While my classmates were studying consulting cases, I hacked in my text editor and terminal to render a Hangman Game while learning how to modularize my code. While my classmates were partying and socializing in the evenings, I sat in a basement and continued learning with online math and programming courses. It brought me pride to be the only person who knew something about the magic in a computer among a bunch of business students.\n\n  \n  \n    David Malan teaches the world's best made online course, CS50, an introduction to computer science. (Photo credit: New Yorker).\n  \n\nAround this time, I completed MIT's 6.00.1x and 6.00.2x and started doing Harvard's CS50 course, of which I eventually completed 70% of the homework. I love CS50 and its people. To this day, it is still the single best online course of any kind and I recommended it to all my close friends who wished to learn programming.\nSoon after, I also discovered Udacity's new program on Deep Learning. Having no clue what deep learning is, I signed up for the course because it sounded cool (nowadays you can learn with free resources like fast.ai). I learned about back propagation, convolutional neural networks, image classification, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). None of that was easy and I definitely did not manage to do everything on my own. And wow! I could train a \"neural network\" to recognize digits in images!\nQuite similar to my earliest experience with programming, I felt often dumbfounded with deep learning but I persisted because the subject was fascinating and because I thought I had no other competitive advantages.\nFailures After Failures, Until Luck Struck\nTo digest my learnings better, I started to write blogs. I was honored that the two pieces I wrote on the basics of deep learning (post #1 and post #2) invited over 240K views in total. (Note: I never found the time nor energy to complete the third blog on backpropagation. Here's an amazing post on backpropagation from Christoph Olah).\nThese little successes boosted my confidence and I decided to look for interesting AI startups to apply for a product, marketing, or bizdev internship in Berlin. I thought about applying for engineering positions after reading Lynn Root's story of her transition into engineering, but I chickened out. Anyways, I reached out to all the startups I could find at the time.\nThe cycle repeated itself. I was either rejected or ignored.\nI remember one startup that I applied to wrote back saying that they did not have a position suitable for me, yet I found out a month later that they hired another person from St. Gallen for a role that I was interested in. That hurt my pride in that moment but, in hindsight, never take these decisions personally. Startups tend to lack a large HR team to digest all the applications and sometimes, not being hired by the wrong employer is a good thing.\nIn my moments of frustration, Lady Fortuna befell on me. I reached out to Moritz, a complete stranger who at the time was the product owner of a deep learning startup, TwentyBN. By then, I had almost given up on finding an internship in Berlin and reached out only because Moritz's profile resembled mine and I thought I could seek some advice to my career path. I clicked the button on his LinkedIn profile and sent a short message.\n\n  \n  \n    A simple LinkedIn message changed my life\n  \n\nLittle did I know that this message landed me an internship and a full-time job that eventually allowed and encouraged me to transit into software development. (Note: In October 2017, before my internship with TwentyBN started, I briefly contributed to an open source project OpenMined in an attempt to gain more experience in software. That experience also scared me because I did not understand Git, Github, unit testing, and CI/CD. I paused it in the excuse of work until April, 2020 when I became a software intern at TwentyBN.)\nDissatisfaction with Career Path\nI worked for 2 years as a product marketer and not for even a day did I feel it was my mission call. I took the job because I fully believed in TwentyBN's people and our technology, but I dislike social media. I wanted to contribute to my company's success but never managed to change my mind about social media marketing. I did not grow much in this position and never felt fulfilled.\nDuring this period of time, I went through an amicable breakup that nevertheless broke my heart. Moreover, I secretly felt my position was being marginalized in the company. My salary rose but deep in my mind, I was frustrated that I could not play a more meaningful role. That depressing feeling I experienced in Switzerland seemed to be rising again.\nWhile a part of me continued to indulge myself in some ocassional evening coding sessions and nerdy programming languages activities, I did not consider software a possibility for me. And I felt I was already too old to go back to a junior position and start over again.\n\n  \n  \n    I tried to change my career by being proactive with marketing ideas. This is a screenshot of the newsletter I led.\n  \n\nAt work, I started writing and editing our company newsletter Embodied AI. In private, I started turning my reading list into book reviews and analysis on leadership in a newsletter called Plutarch.\nWith a desire to build a reputation of my writing, I started experimenting and trying to attract people to sign up for both newsletters. I tried all kinds of marketing channels, got banned by multiple Reddit subreddits, and eventually managed around 500 subscribers for Embodied AI and 100 subscribers for my personal newsletter.\nWith myself, I took a friend Chris's suggestion, overcame my gym-fear and started trying to weightlift and doing calisthenics, which was completely outside my comfort zone.\nFitness gave me dopamine and testosterone. But my newsletter attempts brought me no gratification. I continued and performed a variety of mini-experiments throughout a span of almost a year. Yet my career dissatisfaction continued.\nNever Too Old to Change Career\nTowards the end of 2019, my long dissatisfaction with work manifested into an existential crisis (the coronavirus in 2020 intensified this crisis).\nI came to one grim conclusion: If I were to continue doing product marketing for another 10 years, I would end up hating myself for not taking any action.\nAgain, this voice in my mind suggested software.\nAlready in 2018, I had wanted to ask TwentyBN for an internship as a deep learning engineering intern but I lacked the confidence to make the cut. And by the end of 2019, I heard enough success stories from acquaintances who landed software jobs after bootcamps that my desire to explore software engineering as a career re-kindled.\nDuring my Christmas vacation back in China, I spent all the 3 weeks learning web development with Harvard's CS50W, coding from 8AM in the morning until 1 or 2AM in the night. I wanted to test myself with this intensive experience to see if I had it in me to be a programmer or if it were just a phase. The learning curve was steep and the great firewall prevented me from easy access to Google and StackOverflow. But I managed 2 buggy projects and learned some Flask, Django, Javascript and WebSocket.\n\n  \n  \n    This story persuaded me that I am not too old to make the career switch into software.\n  \n\nWhat was most transformational during these 3 weeks was that, for the first time in almost 14 years, I felt again I was in the zone. I was absorbed in programming. Throughout the day I was contemplating on solving the projects and problems. I even had 2-3 dreams during which I was finding solutions to my code.\nAnd programming suited me way more than product marketing. By nature, marketing is a highly difficult line of work. Viral marketing and growth marketing are well-studied topics, but no one could say with 100% confidence if any single strategy or action was responsible for a product or a company's success.\nProgramming, however, is deadly logical. I was hooked into it because I enjoyed the instant gratification because, sometimes, even a single line of code change could result in a big visual difference. Bug-hunting, while sometimes tedious and frustrating, also gave me huge feelings of reward when I eventually debugged my code and consolidated my learning. This is way better than what I did in the past 2 years!\nIn the end, I worked so hard during those weeks that I did not hear about the COVID19 until I returned from China to Berlin.\nBack at work, I decided that I was not too old to give software engineering a try. I managed to convince my boss Moritz, my Python teamleads, as well as my CTO Ingo to give me a three-month internship with pay reduction. Again, there were sleepless nights and numerous moments of head-banging. The paycut was manageable, but my nervousness of not making the cut and my imposter syndrome added a lot of pressure on my mind.\nBy now, however, my programming experience has taught me what my learning patterns are and I have become more patient with myself. I learned steadily, solved tickets, asked for help, and eventually, the internship turned into a new, full-time position.\nRemake Our \"Self\"\nHaving a family and good friends that unconditionally supported me helped. Having parents who value education and generously supported me in my worst moments helped. Having received a stranger's advice helped. Having learned programming and deep learning helped. Having been a history major with good writing skills helped. And having been on the same wavelength with my company's management and colleagues helped. All of that help was necessary.\nBut equally important, I also must thank Lady Fortuna for making me into a person who has the drive to learn new, seemingly daunting skills to re-make oneself with discipline and tenacity. Without this habit of continuous learning, I could not have achieved what I want.\nAs you might tell, my learning journey as a software Padawan has only just begun. Software engineering is a dynamic and energetic field with many talented people and brilliant ideas. I am still learning how to write good software and how to work across multiple teams.\n\n  \n  \n    TwentyBN and its amazing people\n  \n\nIn April, I have reconnected with the founder of the open source project OpenMined. I began contributing in my limited capacity again so that to give myself more exposure to other programming languages to hone my overall skillset as a developer. It has not been easy but the OpenMined community is an amazing bunch.\nAdditionally, there are knowledge gaps that I have to make up for, such as architecture design, pattern design, as well as well-known algorithms and data structures. I am well aware of these gaps and will continue working on them. After all, I signed up for a career that only works if I continue to learn.\nLa Fin\nMost of us will not have a straightforward career that soars like the rocket. Most of us are destined to encounter career deadlocks at one or another point in our lives. And most of us have the power to do something about it.\nFor me, that included almost a decade of switching majors and wondering what line of work I would be passionate about.\nIt involved facing setbacks and rejections every stop of my journey across United States and Europe. It involved failing a major in business administrations and flunked two exams for the first time in my life. It involved being unhappy about my career path for 2 years.\nBut like Dickens wrote, it was the worst of times, but it was also the best of times. Thanks to all the people who are or had been in my life, I survived. Failures challenged my understanding of my strengths and weaknesses, but none of them destroyed me.\nEach time I was struck down, I cried a bit, rose up, and found consolation in learning new knowledge and acquiring new skills. There was no giving up.\nHere I am today. A new journey just began and I am excited about all the exciting things I will learn along the journey. I am very confident that failures and rejections of all kinds will continue coming my way. I am sure I will have moments of weaknesses and feel defeated. But I have gone through plenty to know that I am strong enough to withstand all of them and continue remaking myself and my life.\nI hid most of these failures from others in the past years. A part of me is still ashamed of them. But I decided to write them down as a form of self-reflection. Moreover, I know someone out there is going through similar experiences. Perhaps these words will help.\nSo here you go. This story is for you and I hope, despite its length, my history resonate with or inspire you so that you can eventually also remake your life. Good luck and never give up.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/my-path-to-programming/","title":"Remake Our Self: My Path to Programming"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/open-source-walk-through-with-rust-seaorm/":{"body":"In this blog post, I'll walk you through an open source PR I submitted to SeaORM with Rust.\n\nThis is a transparent and honest story that serves as a walk-through of my first open source issue after a long break from the open source world. The aim of this blog post is to demystify the process of contributing to open source projects and help the readers realize that open source contribution is (often) challenging but rewarding and fun.\nWhile I use a contribution to Rust’s SeaORM as an example, you do not need any knowledge in Rust to follow this post’s thought process and procedure to take away lessons that might help you start your open source journey in any language or ecosystem.\nIf you like this post or have questions, feel free to share the post and interact with my Twitter handle.\nAlrighty, hop on the wagon and let us begin this story!\nTl;dr\nI know many of you won’t have the time or patience to read my blah blah, so here’s the main take-aways for contributing to open source projects:\n\nPick a project that not only relates to your work or hobby but is also beginner-friendly with maintainers who are willing to offer mentorship and guidance.\nPick an issue that’s beginner-friendly, well-scoped (size small to medium) to make sure you can understand the issue at hand without being overwhelmed.\nCommunicate with the maintainers actively about the issue and possible solutions so that they are onboard with your ideas, vice versa. This way, you save both the maintainers’s and your time when it comes to code review.\nIf you ran into a wall, never hesitate to ask the maintainers for help with detailed, well-formulated questions. If one doesn’t answer, ask another. Maintainers are usually helpful and friendly humans.\nDon’t forget to be polite, communicative, and helpful to others in the open source community 🫶\n\nMotivation to write about open source contribution\nAs software engineers, we are often advised to contribute to open source projects as a way to hone our reading and writing skills as well as to give back to the community. However, many new programmers, including myself, tend to feel very intimidated by open source codebases that might appear foreign, abstract, or overwhelming.\nBecause of this, I decided to create this blog post (and maybe more future posts) to show other open source enthusiasts my process as well as my inner dialogue when working on open source contributions.\nTo make the post more readable and less fragmented, I presented the entire story in more or less a linear storyline. Please keep in mind that the reality is much more complex, complicated, and iterative. There is usually a lot more struggles going into a first contribution to an unfamiliar project, but it is all worth the effort.\nPick a beginner-friendly project\nI was trying out Rust Tokio’s axum web framework for building APIs when I encountered a mild issue: I am not particularly good at raw SQL.\nIn my previous job, I worked mostly in Django (with a little bit of Go), which has an amazing ORM that spoiled me. I am certainly happy and willing to hone my SQL skills, but I also wondered if there was a decent ORM framework in Rust.\nBy chance, I landed on the homepage of SeaQL, the project behind the Rust crate SeaORM, an async, dynamic, and testable ORM that supports Postgres, MySQL, and SQLite at the time this blog post was written. It seems like a project with a lot of care from its creators, so I decided to see if there’s an opportunity for doing some open source contribution.\nIt’s good to iterate on an important point in open source contribution: Choose a project that matters to us! Working on a codebase means that we must play with the code ourselves. If the project does not relate to our work or hobby, then we’d be reluctant to play with the code or to test the code we write for the project. I’m a backend engineer and I interact with databases all the time, so an ORM for Rust seems meaningful to me and I’d love to play with SeaORM.\nChoose a beginner-friendly issue\nThe first thing I did was skimming through the open issues of SeaORM. Luckily, SeaORM’s maintainers are very active and it was easy for me to spot a good first issue: Add flag to sea-orm-cli to generate code for time crate&nbsp;#661.\nKeep in mind that some projects aren’t actively labelling good first issue issues and some maintainers don’t have the time or capacity to mentor or guide new contributors.\nI personally avoid those projects because I didn’t see myself as very good at navigating on foreign terrain in a codebase due to having programmed professionally for only 2 years. With more years of experience, we’d become better at this.\nUnderstand the issue\nBack to the story. As the issuer suggested in the link: Since the&nbsp;time&nbsp;crate is supported as alternative to&nbsp;chrono,&nbsp;it should be possible to generate code for&nbsp;time crate.\nFor those who don’t know enough about Rust, there are 2 crates in Rust that deal with time and date, time and chrono (note that a crate is the equivalent of a gem in Ruby or package in Python and Javascript).\nThe problem at hand seems to be that sea-orm-cli, the command line tool for SeaORM, appeared to generate only code that corresponds to chrono's datetime types and some users would like to have a feature in the command line tool to generate time's datetime types without having to write custom code themselves.\nDefine questions for solving the issue\nHaving had very little experience writing CLI tools in Rust (or any language for that matter), I laid down some bullet points that I needed clarification in order to work on this issue:\n\nWhere in the codebase is the chrono's datetime types being generated?\nHow do I use sea-orm-cli to reproduce the reported issue so that I can progressively iterate towards a solution?\nWhat kind of a flag would the maintainers be happy to accept for the finished feature?\n\nFind the relevant code for the issue at hand\nI posted the first question to the issue’s thread:\n\nI'm looking for a&nbsp;good first issue :) Just wondering how one is generating code for&nbsp;chrono&nbsp;right now?\n\nBilly, one of the maintainers, was quick to reply an answer:\n\nHey&nbsp;@nahuakang, welcome! You can take a look at:\n\n// sea-orm/sea-orm-codegen/src/entity/column.rs\n// https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm/blob/86e7e808b37179315a1cc5c6c852764830c04661/sea-orm-codegen/src/entity/column.rs#L47-L51\n \n ColumnType::Date =&gt; \"Date\".to_owned(), \n ColumnType::Time(_) =&gt; \"Time\".to_owned(), \n ColumnType::DateTime(_) =&gt; \"DateTime\".to_owned(), \n ColumnType::Timestamp(_) =&gt; \"DateTimeUtc\".to_owned(), \n ColumnType::TimestampWithTimeZone(_) =&gt; \"DateTimeWithTimeZone\".to_owned(),\n\nOkay, at least now I have some code that I can read. I felt some adrenaline kicking into my system now that I got the first thread of code to investigate. But my dearest enemy, imposter syndrome, also kicked in.\nI started questioning myself and wondered if I’d be able to actually come up with a solution? After all, some good first issue issues aren’t that easy. What if I can’t solve it and embarrass myself? Because of this, I procrastinated.\nCommunicate with maintainers before coding\nAs a seasoned procrastinator, I waited for a day before I posted the next two questions:\n\n@billy1624 Thanks! I'm reading the docs as well as trying to understand the workflow with&nbsp;sea-orm&nbsp;now. Are there any examples/tests that demonstrate how to use&nbsp;sea-orm-cli&nbsp;to generate code for entities involving&nbsp;chrono? I haven't seen a&nbsp;chrono\n&nbsp;flag in&nbsp;sea-orm-cli&nbsp;so I wonder if the solution here is to add a flag for&nbsp;time&nbsp;crate or something else (like handling&nbsp;time&nbsp;types)?\n\nLuckily, it was the weekend so it took Billy a few days to respond, by which time I had calmed down from my imposter anxiety:\n\nHey&nbsp;@nahuakang, you can simply create a database table with timestamp / datetime columns. Then, follow the steps on&nbsp;https://www.sea-ql.org/SeaORM/docs/generate-entity/sea-orm-cli, to generate entity files with&nbsp;sea-orm-cli.\nWe don't have a&nbsp;chrono&nbsp;flag for&nbsp;sea-orm-cli, since it's the default crate to represent datetime crate as of now. I think we can add an option,&nbsp;--date-time-crate, to&nbsp;sea-orm-cli generate entity. It will take values such as&nbsp;chrono&nbsp;/&nbsp;time&nbsp;with&nbsp;chrono&nbsp;being the default. This way it's backward compatible and users can opt-in to it.\nThoughts?\n\nOkay, so the flag for this option should be --date-time-crate and we should run the new feature like:\n# To use the time crate for the command\n$ sea-orm-cli generate entity --date-time-crate=time -u postgres://nahua:password@localhost:5432/timetest -o src/entity\n\n# To use the chrono crate for the command\n$ sea-orm-cli generate entity --date-time-crate=chrono -u postgres://nahua:password@localhost:5432/timetest -o src/entity\n\nThis is good. So I claimed this issue and began working towards a solution in a format that I knew the maintainers would be willing to accept.\nFamiliarize ourselves with the documentation\nQuick pause to clarify some important details before jumping into the solution section.\nDuring this entire time as I communicated with Billy, I was actively reading SeaORM’s documentation. It’s a new ORM and it does things differently from what I did in the Python world.\nThe most important bits I learned from the documentation that helped me solve the issue were:\n\nEntity: The representation of a table in SeaORM. In the column types section, I found out about how the time and chrono Rust datetime types correspond to SeaORM’s types.\nsea-orm-cli: I learned how to use the CLI tool that I was now supposed to fix.\n\nReproduce the issue\nTo reproduce the existing issue, I needed to do a few things:\n\nA minimal Rust cargo project to generate the entities in\nA running database of my choice that SeaORM can connect to (Postgres)\nGenerate a table full of date &amp; time types\nRun the command to confirm the issue\nInvestigate the code more to understand where I could add the feature to solve the issue\n\n1. Create a minimal cargo project\nThis is really easy in Rust. I simply ran the following command:\n$ cargo new playground\n$ cd playground\n$ tree\n.\n├── Cargo.toml\n├── README.md\n└── src\n    └── main.rs\n\nSince I know I’ll be only generating entity files (in any directory of my choice) to observe whether sea-orm-cli could generate code that has the correct types for chrono or time given the user’s choice, this barebone project would suffice without any extra boilerplate code.\nI installed the latest distribution of sea-orm-cli with the following command:\n$ cargo install sea-orm-cli\n\n2. Spin up a Postgres DB\nI have Postgres installed on my Macbook, but I really like using Docker for spinning up a garbage DB that I can test in, so I copy-pasted a very simple docker-compose file that I use a lot for job interviews:\nversion: \"3.3\"\nservices:\n  db:\n    image: postgres:latest\n    container_name: postgres\n    restart: always\n    ports:\n      - 5432:5432\n    environment:\n      - POSTGRES_USER=nahua\n      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password\n      - POSTGRES_DB=timetest\n    volumes:\n      - timetest:/var/lib/postgres/data\n  \n  adminer:\n    image: adminer:latest\n    restart: always\n    ports:\n      - 8080:8080\n\nvolumes:\n  timetest:\n\nThis is not a tutorial on Docker so the gist is that with this docker-compose file, I can spin up a postgres database by simply running the following command:\n# Using -d flag for detach mode\n$ docker compose up -d\n\nThe database would have a user nahua with a password password as well as a DB named timetest that’s listening on the port 5432. To examine the database easily, I could login onto adminer on localhost:8080.\n3. Create a test DB table\nWith the DB spinning, I procrastinated again because I dreaded writing raw SQL commands, not knowing exactly which types I should write.\nAbout a day later, I overcame my inertia and logged in to the database to create the following test table that was filled with some relevant date &amp; time types:\n# Access the running database as the user \"nahua\" for the DB \"timetest\"\n# Then run SQL command to create a table called \"time_tests\"\n$ docker exec -it postgres /usr/bin/psql -U nahua -d timetest\npsql (14.2 (Debian 14.2-1.pgdg110+1))\nType \"help\" for help.\n\ntimetest=# CREATE TABLE time_tests (\n  id SERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,\n  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),\n  created_date DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),\n  created_time TIME NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()\n);\ntimetest=# \\q\n\n4. Reproduce the issue for sanity check\nI ran the following commands per specification of the documentation and confirmed that I had everything set up properly for testing my code later on:\n$ sea-orm-cli generate entity -u postgres://nahua:password@localhost:5432/timetest -o .\n\nIn essence, sea-orm-cli would connect to the DB table I spun up and fetch the schema of the time_tests table and translate it into Rust code, i.e. entities files in my barebone project’s src/ directory.\nThis would generate the following files:\n$ tree\n.\n├── Cargo.toml\n├── mod.rs\n├── prelude.rs\n├── seaql_migrations.rs\n├── src\n│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── main.rs\n└── time_tests.rs\n\nAnd time_tests.rs is the file of interest here:\n$ cat time_tests.rs\n//!

A few things I kept in mind were:\n\nHow the sea-orm-cli code works and how I could insert a new flag --date-time-crate?\nOnce the user could specify --date-time-crate value, how do I pass this information down to the part of the code that Billy shared, i.e. into the Column.get_rs_type method that was in charge of converting chrono types or time types and translate it into Rust types for the output files we had above?\nWhich other functions or objects are using Column.get_rs_type because I must adjust these functions as part of the clean-up after implementing the new feature?\n\n1. The Structure of SeaORM project\nAs the Cargo.toml suggests, sea-orm has the following workspaces:\n[workspace]\nmembers = [\".\", \"sea-orm-macros\", \"sea-orm-codegen\"]\n\nExamining the structure, we can see that sea-orm-cli is sort of a stand-alone project living inside sea-orm and sea-orm-codegen is the workspace that contains the Column.get_rs_type method that Billy originated pointed me to.\n$ pwd\n/path/to/our/seaql/sea-orm\n\n$ tree -L 1\n...\n├── Cargo.toml\n...\n├── sea-orm-cli\n├── sea-orm-codegen\n...\n├── src\n...\n└── tests\n\nThis means that my feature would almost exclusively reside in sea-orm-cli/ and sea-orm-codegen/ directories.\n2. Adding a new CLI flag\nBy examining the file sea-orm/sea-orm-cli/src/cli.rs, I quickly familiarized myself with how the project uses clap to generate CLI commands and flags and wrote a new flag for --date-time-crate (click for a Github view):\n// sea-orm-cli/src/cli.rs\n\npub fn build_cli() -&gt; App&lt;'static, 'static&gt; {\n                ...\n                ).arg(\n                    Arg::with_name(\"DATE_TIME_CRATE\")\n                        .long(\"date-time-crate\")\n                        .help(\"The datetime crate to use for generating entities.\")\n                        .takes_value(true)\n                        .possible_values(&amp;[\"chrono\", \"time\"])\n                        .default_value(\"chrono\")\n                ),\n        ...\n}\n\n3. Refactor; add a context struct and date time crate enum\nI also traced the usage of Column.get_rs_type all the way back to sea-orm/sea-orm-cli/src/commands.rs where the following lines would generate the entities:\n// sea-orm-cli/src/commands.rs\n\npub async fn run_generate_command(matches: &amp;ArgMatches&lt;'_&gt;) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;&gt; {\n\t\t...\n            let output = EntityTransformer::transform(table_stmts)?\n\t               .generate(expanded_format, WithSerde::from_str(with_serde).unwrap());\n\t\t...\n}\n\nSo I somehow needed to pass the user’s date-time-crate choice into EntityWriter.generate method so that Column.get_rs_type would eventually pick up this data and act accordingly. Essentially, I needed some sort of a context struct for this job.\nI talked with Billy about this and he pointed me to his comment on another standing PR:\n\nHey&nbsp;@negezor, thanks for the updates! I think the semantic isn't seems right. The transformer,&nbsp;EntityTransformer::transform(table_stmts, name_resolver), don't need name resolver. Instead, we could have introduce a new struct called&nbsp;EntityWriterContext which contains three things...\n\npub struct EntityWriterContext {\n\t\tpub(crate) expanded_format: bool,\n\t\tpub(crate) with_serde: WithSerde,\n\t\tpub(crate) name_resolver: NameResolver,\n}\n\n\nThen,&nbsp;EntityWriter::generate&nbsp;method would take an&nbsp;EntityWriterContext. Thoughts?\n\nThis was very helpful! So I wrote the following struct with a new method that specified the variables needed by EntityWriter.generate to generate the entities:\n// sea-orm-codegen/src/entity/writer.rs\n\n#[derive(Debug)]\npub struct EntityWriterContext {\n    pub(crate) expanded_format: bool,\n    pub(crate) with_serde: WithSerde,\n    pub(crate) date_time_crate: DateTimeCrate,\n}\n\nimpl EntityWriterContext {\n    pub fn new(\n        expanded_format: bool,\n        with_serde: WithSerde,\n        date_time_crate: DateTimeCrate,\n    ) -&gt; Self {\n        Self {\n            expanded_format,\n            with_serde,\n            date_time_crate,\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nMeanwhile, let’s also work out a DateTimeCrate enum so that we could store information about which crate the user chooses:\n// sea-orm-codegen/src/entity/writer.rs\n\n#[derive(Debug)]\npub enum DateTimeCrate {\n    Chrono,\n    Time,\n}\n\nimpl FromStr for DateTimeCrate {\n    type Err = crate::Error;\n\n    fn from_str(s: &amp;str) -&gt; Result&lt;Self, Self::Err&gt; {\n        Ok(match s {\n            \"chrono\" =&gt; Self::Chrono,\n            \"time\" =&gt; Self::Time,\n            v =&gt; {\n                return Err(crate::Error::TransformError(format!(\n                    \"Unsupported enum variant '{}'\",\n                    v\n                )))\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n\nThese changes are all available here on Github.\nWith the EntityWriterContext struct and the DateTimeCrate enum ready, I could basically write the following in sea-orm-cli to let the command pass the --date-time-crate information to the code that generates the entities files:\n// sea-orm-cli/src/commands.rs\n\npub async fn run_generate_command(matches: &amp;ArgMatches&lt;'_&gt;) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;&gt; {\n        ...\n        let date_time_crate = args.value_of(\"DATE_TIME_CRATE\").unwrap();\n        ...\n        let writer_context = EntityWriterContext::new(\n            expanded_format,\n            WithSerde::from_str(with_serde).unwrap(),\n            DateTimeCrate::from_str(date_time_crate).unwrap(),\n        );\n        let output = EntityTransformer::transform(table_stmts)?.generate(&amp;writer_context);\n}\n\n4. Sew the thread\nNow that we’ve introduced an EntityWriterContext, we must update all the methods that would be affected by it until we’ve reached Column.get_rs_type method. This part was quite mechanical and rather easy and the changes can be found here and here, mostly in the sea-orm-codegen/src/entity/base_entity.rs file and sea-orm-codegen/src/entity/writer.rs file.\n5. Translate different crate types into correct column types\nFinally, we have arrived at the beginning of this story when Billy showed me the original code that should be impacted by this feature change:\n// sea-orm-codegen/src/entity/column.rs\n\npub fn get_rs_type(&amp;self) -&gt; TokenStream {\n    ...\n        #[allow(unreachable_patterns)]\n        let ident: TokenStream = match &amp;self.col_type {\n            ColumnType::Char(_)\n            ...\n            ColumnType::Float(_) =&gt; \"f32\".to_owned(),\n            ColumnType::Double(_) =&gt; \"f64\".to_owned(),\n            ColumnType::Json | ColumnType::JsonBinary =&gt; \"Json\".to_owned(),\n            ColumnType::Date =&gt; \"Date\".to_owned(),\n            ColumnType::Time(_) =&gt; \"Time\".to_owned(),\n            ColumnType::DateTime(_) =&gt; \"DateTime\".to_owned(),\n            ColumnType::Timestamp(_) =&gt; \"DateTimeUtc\".to_owned(),\n            ColumnType::TimestampWithTimeZone(_) =&gt; \"DateTimeWithTimeZone\".to_owned(),\n    ...\n}\n\nI decided to just do some nested match expressions to translate the types properly given the variable date_time_crate that we’ve passed down from the command line via the EntityWriterContext struct:\n// sea-orm-codegen/src/entity/column.rs\n\npub fn get_rs_type(&amp;self, date_time_crate: &amp;DateTimeCrate) -&gt; TokenStream {\n    ...\n        #[allow(unreachable_patterns)]\n        let ident: TokenStream = match &amp;self.col_type {\n            ColumnType::Char(_)\n            ...\n            ColumnType::Float(_) =&gt; \"f32\".to_owned(),\n            ColumnType::Double(_) =&gt; \"f64\".to_owned(),\n            ColumnType::Json | ColumnType::JsonBinary =&gt; \"Json\".to_owned(),\n            ColumnType::Date =&gt; match date_time_crate {\n                DateTimeCrate::Chrono =&gt; \"Date\".to_owned(),\n                DateTimeCrate::Time =&gt; \"TimeDate\".to_owned(),\n            },\n            ColumnType::Time(_) =&gt; match date_time_crate {\n                DateTimeCrate::Chrono =&gt; \"Time\".to_owned(),\n                DateTimeCrate::Time =&gt; \"TimeTime\".to_owned(),\n            },\n            ColumnType::DateTime(_) =&gt; match date_time_crate {\n                DateTimeCrate::Chrono =&gt; \"DateTime\".to_owned(),\n                DateTimeCrate::Time =&gt; \"TimeDateTime\".to_owned(),\n            },\n            ColumnType::Timestamp(_) =&gt; match date_time_crate {\n                DateTimeCrate::Chrono =&gt; \"DateTimeUtc\".to_owned(),\n                // ColumnType::Timpestamp(_) =&gt; time::PrimitiveDateTime: https://docs.rs/sqlx/0.3.5/sqlx/postgres/types/index.html#time\n                DateTimeCrate::Time =&gt; \"TimeDateTime\".to_owned(),\n            },\n            ColumnType::TimestampWithTimeZone(_) =&gt; match date_time_crate {\n                DateTimeCrate::Chrono =&gt; \"DateTimeWithTimeZone\".to_owned(),\n                DateTimeCrate::Time =&gt; \"TimeDateTimeWithTimeZone\".to_owned(),\n            },\n    ...\n}\n\nChanges can be viewed on Github here.\n6. Test the code and try it out\nBefore finishing up, I wrote some unit tests for distinguishing time from chrono types in the Column.get_rs_type method.\nNow, since everything is ready, we should test the end product. Let’s install sea-orm-cli from our updated local source code by running:\n$ pwd\n/path/to/our/seaql/sea-orm/sea-orm-cli\n\n# This installs `sea-orm-cli` from our local source code\n$ cargo install --path .\n\nFinally, I ran the sea-orm-cli command in my barebone project to see if I could generate the correct entity files with the correct types given chrono or time crate specification:\n$ sea-orm-cli generate entity --date-time-crate time -u postgres://nahua:password@localhost:5432/timetest -o .\n\n$ cat time_tests.rs\n//!

Unfortunately, given professional and private reasons, I could not contribute to the course development. Therefore, I hope to write and collect notes from the courses and offer them as my minor contribution to this open source community that I love and believe in.\n\nPrivacy is fundamental to our lives, yet for the past three decades since the rise of the internet, each individual has lost a large chunk of their private information to companies as well as political entities.\nFor instance, social media platforms collect and analyze large amounts of user data or sell them to other companies. Some governments collect data via mass surveillance programs to monitor their citizens. News networks are increasingly known to offer biased opinions and misinformation to their audience based on information about their target audience’s political beliefs and social values, thus polarizing society to the two extremes on the spectrum.\nBut despite hearing so much news and debates about privacy, how do we actually define this concept? What does information flow have to do with privacy? How should we respond to social media platforms and other service providers that violate our private data? Should private data be kept absolute private? Or can we utilize some form of technology to safely share data for social good? What are some serious problems caused by bad information flows and violation of privacy? How do some societies and communities solve these challenges?\nThese are some of the questions that this lesson tries to discuss. Below are the notes.\nInformation Flow\nGist: Society runs on information flow, which is everywhere. From supranational organizations down to individual groups of humans, we live our lives and make decisions based on information that flows across different channels.\nDefinition of Information Flow: A flow of bits from a sender to receiver with some probability. This probabilistic nature matters because you often don't get to share a piece of information exactly to one recipient. Unintended recipients are involved.\nExample: Imagine Andrew is gossiping with Emma in a pub, thinking their conversation is private. The pub is loud and Emma only hears bits and pieces of Andrew’s voice. Meanwhile, by coincidence, Nahua sits in the booth next to them and overhears parts of the gossip.\nPrivacy\nGist: Privacy is about the (appropriate) flow of information, not necessarily about the information itself.\nDefinition of privacy: Privacy is not about simply keeping information private, but rather the ability to ensure flows of information that satisfy social norms.\nThe Concept of Contextual Integrity: The best definition of privacy is coined by Helen Nissenbaum as the concept of Contextual Integrity. Contextual integrity's core aim is to provide a description for when people feel that their privacy is violated. If you use a piece of data from someone and they care about how you might use the information from the data, then you’re using private data. It does not matter if this piece of data is labeled “private” by law or not because privacy is about the flow of information in context of social norms.\nExample: Each human face is a public information because every time you go out into the world, your face is public and can be viewed by anyone who passes you. However, facial recognition software is controversial and troubling. This is because the identification of faces is without consent. The information is not necessarily private, but the information flow is highly inappropriate in the context where people do not expect their faces to be used for identification software or, worse, surveillance purposes.\nConclusion: Privacy is not just about private information leaking out, but also about public information that might become even more public. Some information flows in a way that people do not expect or do not like. It’s about expectation of how the data flows.\nThe Importance of Data and Privacy\nGist: Data is fire. Privacy is about data. Privacy matters even to the people who think “I have nothing to hide.”\nData-is-Fire Analogy: Data is compared to oil and electricity by many renowned researchers and journalists. We say data is fire because:\n\nData can be shared unlimited number of times\nData has its dual use for both good and bad.\nData is ubiquitously present throughout the society.\n\nWhy care? You may have nothing to hide right now but, at a certain point in your life, you might have changes in life that you don’t want others to know about, such as medical records.\nAlso, given the rise of highly powerful machine learning models, AI can infer or predict information about an individual from seemingly non-sensitive or unrelated public information. All this information can be used for targeting, i.e. advertising, targeted disinformation, or even deliberate physical harm.\nAnonymization does not work: Anonymization is important because knowing or not knowing the identifying information would protect an individual from certain types of targeting. However, data anonymization does not work anymore. It cannot protect individuals because you don’t even need the ID or the name of a person to target them! As long as you know enough about a person and have a way to reach them, you can target them.\nExample: Fitness app Strava has collected anonymized user data and generated a heatmap, which outlines the exercise routes of military personnels in bases around the world. The data is anonymous but it reveals important information that could not only harm individuals but national security interest.\nPrivacy &amp; Transparency Dilemmas\nGist: Data is fire. So there exists a constant trade-off on whether to reveal sensitive data for social good, such as medical research that would solve certain illnesses, or social hazard, such as leakage of sensitive data or mass surveillance. The trade-off involves privacy and transparency dilemmas, which are two sides of the same coin.\nPrivacy-Dilemma: A lot of data can generate social good but is prone to violation of individual privacy and malicious intentions.\nTransparency Dilemma: Too little data might protect individual privacy but negatively impact the decision-making process and the accuracy of a decision.\nPrivacy-Transparency Trade-Off: This trade-off underpins many societal challenges as it is historically a Pareto trade-off, i.e. where one gains, the other loses. The important question here is: Can we get more of both instead of a zero-sum game? How can we remove this Pareto trade-off for industries that could benefit from this hurdle to generate social good?\nExample: Too much private data leakage could lead to companies knowing too much about their customers without the customers’ consent. Target figured out a teen girl was pregnant before her father did because of too much private data being collected and analyzed. However, maximizing privacy can lead to a lack of transparency. Each person must make a decision based on limited information and social proofs. How do you know if a product you buy on Amazon is good or not if no other user provides any information of their experiences? Or if the product reviews might be fake? The information you need to make a decision exists but you might not have access to this information flow, or the information flow exists but the output isn’t verified.\nAreas Where We Urgently Need Solutions to Privacy-Transparency Trade-Off\nResearch:\nResearch is almost always constrained by information flows.\nExample: Deep learning researchers rely heavily on data. They often have to build and collect their own datasets. They want to collaborate with each other and ensure that the methods they develop are robust, not biased, and can generalize on data across the population. To make sure the tools work, researchers must foster a transparent environment to ensure data is used for good. Meanwhile, they must also ensure that the data being used will remain private.\nTo empower researchers to make breakthroughs across disciplines and generate social good, we need the solution to solve the privacy-transparency tradeoff.\nHealthy Market Competition for Information Services\nAny services that handle users’ personal data are services that benefit from locking you in. These services are anti-competitive by nature because of data privacy. So the privacy-transparency trade-off is a lose-lose scenario for the customer and the market is not competitive. These companies often have a strong incentive to centralize user data into silos. As a consumer, you are often locked in for good.\nQuestion: Is locking all data down the solution to privacy?\nThe sharing of data has two very subtly different scenarios:\n\nA user switching services and brings data with them due to user-specific interests.\nA company gets user consent to sell data to other companies due to its profit-seeking interests.\n\nThe current popular narrative that “data should not be shared at all” is in the interest of some of the most privacy-intrusive companies. Such narrative, if written into law, would enable companies with private data to become monopolies because users can no longer switch services easily.\nInteroperability: What we need is an improvement in interoperability among service providers. Interoperability means that you can buy your shoes from one company and socks from another. Computers are very interoperable. We can always make computerized systems to be interoperable. But the law surrounding computers prevents interoperability, and can be even a crime. So dominant companies can decide who can interoperate with them, resulting in a lack of market competitiveness.\nExample 1: Interoperability is the reason how many startups got hold of their grounds. Facebook was interoperable with Myspace via password and messages. That was adversarial interoperability. Myspace users could send or receive messages with friends from Facebook or vice versa.\nExample 2: GDPR is an example that empowers consumers and improves interoperability. GDPR gives consumers 7 rights, including the right of access (send you a copy of all your data) and the right to be forgotten (approach companies to delete almost all your data). GDPR makes companies more responsible and accountable for handling user data.\nConclusion: The simple narrative that “locking all data down could solve the privacy problem” can backfire on our goal to improve privacy. If we want to protect privacy, we need organizations to be forced to share information in many cases, especially when a user wants to switch services. This allows privacy concerns to drive market competition. In the end, satisfying privacy can also be about forcing companies to share information in the way you want them to. It’s about stopping flows that are harmful and forcing flows that are beneficial.\nData, Energy &amp; the Environment\nEnergy is a field where privacy-transparency trade-off affects public good. Coordinating energy demand on a nationwide scale requires serious collaboration efforts.\nThe ability to analyze data on the energy grid is important. Smart meters can help people become smarter about their energy usage. Greener, low-carbon future depends on our ability to use such data wisely.\nBut this can be very privacy-invasive as the data could be used to draw out a detail about a household’s activities and behavioral patterns, such as when you are home or not and what you are using (even what TV channels you are watching). It could become a form of mass surveillance. So we need to have systems that ensure the privacy-transparency trade-off for such collaboration.\nExample: Data coalitions in Taiwan. In Taiwan, citizens have air boxes at home to detect air quality due to air pollution blowing from China. In this space, public environmental polity is low but private environmental polity is high. So private Taiwanese citizens gather together to pull data together to learn from each other and then use that pool of data, which the government does not produce but desires, to bargain for what citizens want: More units of such installation in public parks, military areas, etc.\nConclusion: It is possible for millions of people to collaborate on a large scale to solve urgent challenges.\nFeedback Mechanisms &amp; Information Flows\nFeedback Mechanism is everywhere and is the bedrock of our society because each individual navigates their social settings via signals from feedback mechanisms. We have always relied on each other to make daily decisions, such as which car to buy, which restaurants to go, etc. Individual actions are influenced by social forces.\nExamples: Amazon product reviews, presidential elections, protests, Facebook likes, imprisonment or punishments, gossips are all feedback mechanisms.\nBut because of the privacy-transparency trade-off, many feedback mechanisms are broken. Sometimes feedback information is so sensitive or valuable that it can be misused for malign purposes. Lack of feedback mechanism can sometimes lead to alleviation of someone’s accountability for certain actions completely, paving the way for openly malicious actions.\nExample: How good is your surgeon when you go into surgery? Where could you get feedback about the surgeon? How much feedback could you get? If you cannot get the information easily, the feedback mechanism is probably broken.\nDemocracy &amp; Healthy Public Conversation\nPublic squares: In the past, a public square for political debates or discourses could be a pub or a town hall. Today, public squares become more symbolic and virtual: Social media, TV channels, door-to-door activists are all forms of public square.\nProblem: A trend nowadays is the polarization of political opinions among a nation’s population. This is caused by the privacy-transparency trade-off and the mal-functioning of information flows.\nExample: Taiwan used a platform called Polis to optimize for consensus and unity among people, improve public discourse, and cut through noise and trolling on the internet.\nConclusion: We can have a community-build, consensus-facilitating platform that informs government on the desire of people and helps the people to update themselves based on what they learned about their community. Social media does not have to divide us. All we have to do is to optimize tech to bring people together. We can build novel information-flow systems that benefit society.\nNew Market Incentives\nIncentives are heavily intertwined with information flows.\nExample: Attention is the most dominant incentive on the internet. Netflix, Facebook, and most internet companies seek attention and optimize for attention (even human sleep is seen as a competition for Netflix).\nProblem: Companies lack proper heuristics to measure their successes. Measuring attention is the best heuristic for these companies because attention reveals a huge amount of information about each individual. Attention is the most readily available and successful metric on the internet.\nIdeation on Incentives: We must, however, have better heuristics to measure than attention. After all, customer loyalty is more important than attention for Netflix. But how would Netflix adjust itself? Wellness metrics are such details that Netflix could use but they are not readily available. So Netflix cannot optimize for these wellness metrics. Customers end up being the losers who are addicted to the platform and could become sleep-deprived. Therefore, we must have safer information flows to help companies establish proper incentives that do not generate a negative impact on their customers.\nSafe Data Networks for Business, Governance and R&amp;D\nExample: Developing EU-wide products and services requires EU-wide data access. Data must be able to flow easily across the EU and be used in a productive and safe manner. Such data flows can be beneficial especially in situations like a global pandemic.\nQuestion: What’s the ideal information flow? Why not entirely free-flowing?\nFirst of all, trade secrets must be protected. Secondly, a country’s data is also crucial for that country’s national security and economic prospects. So who controls the data matters. Anonymizing data isn’t enough. Therefore, data cannot be allowed to free-flow across the EU.\nIdeation for Solution: Ideal information flow of sensitive data should be that the data is only shared in a privacy-preserving manner. But sharing data across space means that we still have a data governance problem. What if the data does not have to move? What if one nation holds the data and another can access it remotely in a privacy-preserving manner? Today, we have technology, such as differential privacy, that enables such privacy-preserving sharing of data without the data leaving its physical storage. This can maintain the trust for safe EU-wide data collaboration.\nConflict, Political Science, and Information Flows\nFrom your problem with your significant other to the worker’s union against enterprises to wars among nations, conflicts are everywhere in our everyday life.\nMutual Optimism: “Rationalist explanations for war” is the most famous work on why nations enter war with each other. It coined the term mutual optimism, which suggests that wars occur when two countries’ leaders have simultaneous, overly optimistic estimations about how they’d fare in a military action.\nPrivacy in Political Conflicts: There’s private information involved about willingness of a nation to go to war. For instance, if nation A knew that it had developed a new weapon that it believed nation B did not possess, this is a piece of private information that could affect the decision-making process.\nIdeation: But what if two nations could be able to determine the result of the war somehow before they launched their missiles and instead negotiate to settle? No blood is drawn and conflict could be resolved.\nProblem: Since neither side has all the information to make a proper estimation of the outcome of a potential war, each side might think that they have the upper hand. So we need an approach to reveal such secret information without each party actually leaking the sensitive information to the other party while being able to estimate an outcome of a conflict.\nExample: 3rd party negotiation for Indo-Pakistan conflict (Note: the video clip was not available in the lecture).\nDisinformation &amp; Information Flows\nDisinformation: Often in life, we are reliant on what we are told. Is what we are told actually true? These days, we rely on entire strangers on the internet to tell us information. Additionally, centralized global news networks have a tremendous influence in disseminating information to people. Society’s most important feedback mechanisms rely on such information. So whether the news is true or not is one of the most important questions out there.\nFreedom of Speech is fundamental to democracies. Historically, freedom of speech centered around the analog form of communication. Communication at scale was not a problem and you could only be heard at scale via a trusted communicator. Freedom of speech was by default not to be immediately heard by everyone in the world. You could still be heard by everyone, but it would not be instant. Information was shared among trusted networks and filtered.\nFreedom of Speech at Scale: Scale is achieved by the social networks built via the internet. Now everyone can push a button and be seen or heard by the whole world on social networks. This tremendous reach redefines the information flows facilitated by the freedom of speech and leads to mass misinformation.\nQuestion: So what should happen if a piece of information is false?\nThere are many proposed solutions. Some suggest asking social networks to self-censor. Some seek solutions in machine learning models. None of these are long-term viable approaches because of the information bottleneck. Or, one could get off social networks and never use them again. But there are better ways to tackle this problem.\nExample: Taiwan got citizens activated to help each other understand the limitation of information. Not taking things down, but adding comments to other sources. The comments come from users related to a reader. So the community is watching out for everyone in it and helping each other. Also, humor over rumor when fighting misinformation:\n\nFirst, framing of the challenge is less about identifying lies and taking them down, but more about fostering a national community that helps each other to filter truths from lies. Volunteers help their local communities by commenting on posts.\nSecond, Taiwan uses humor to foster trust in the civil society to discredit fake news.\n\nConclusion: When thinking about disinformation, it is important to take into account how society has historically dealt with the problem. We cannot think just in a pure technologist approach. Removing a social network won’t fix the problem. It’s a fast removal but not solving the cause of the problem. Don’t choose the most scalable option but scale a movement of everyday people bringing trust and care into each other’s life. What’s the most compelling way to activate people to help their friends? That’s the good question to ask. It’s not a new issue. We’ve dealt with it before. Seek to use technology and scale these existing mechanisms so that the society is more ready to adopt the solution.\nTakeaway\nPrivacy technology is not just about privacy but about creating information flows in society that maximize social good.\nWhen thinking about privacy and the uses of privacy, don’t ask just where do we need more privacy but ask how can our society accomplish a goal with less risk, higher accuracy, faster speed, and more aligned incentives through better flows of information.\nIt’s not about hiding data but enabling specific data flows to empower researchers, governments, and citizens.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/series/privacy_ai_course_notes/course-1-lesson-2-summary/","title":"Course 1 Lesson 2: Summary - Society Runs on Information Flows"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/series/privacy_ai_course_notes/course-1-lesson-3-summary/":{"body":"This post is a summary of Course 1, Lesson 3 of OpenMined's new private AI series, Our Privacy Opportunity and covers the limitations of information flow, including the copy problem, the bundling problem, and the recursive enforcement problem.\n\n\nFor a Google Doc version of the summary, click here. Feel free to comment in the Gdoc to help improve the summary notes.\n\nRecap: This course is about improving and fixing the information flows. To fix information flows, we must pinpoint and articulate exactly what is not working and what sub-problems are preventing us from having both improved privacy and transparency.\nThis lesson specifically discusses 3 types of problems:\n\nThe Copy Problem\nThe Bundling Problem\nThe Recursive Enforcement Problem\n\nThe Copy Problem\nDefinition of The Copy Problem: If I share a piece of information, e.g. a document, a photo, or a video, with another party, I immediately lose control of how this other party might use the information later. To share the information, I must trust the other party.\nChallenges:\n\nLegal enforcement is difficult: Even though regulations such as GDPR are in place, it is extremely difficult to enforce that everyone complies with the law.\nLimiting the power of computers: Truly solving the copy problem could mean limiting the power of our computer.\nSurveillance: Or, machines must be able to detect when you are recording information that is not yours. That’d require very invasive surveillance software.\n\nExamples:\n\nThe entertainment industry suffers from digital piracy. Digital rights management (DRM) software came into being to prevent your computer from playing files that you did not purchase. They represent a central authority threat to individual privacy. But if the creators cannot capture value from their creation, the industry suffers.\nDropbox monitors what you upload and see if it contains copy-written material.\n\nQuestion: Given the problem and the challenges, should we stop the uncontrolled copying of data? No. Controlling copying is a double-edged sword. When you store other people’s information, you copy. Limiting this ability could have serious problems.\nThe Bundling Problem\nDefinition of The Bundling Problem: It is often extremely difficult to share a piece of intended information without revealing additional unintended information to verify the intended information. This is also called data lumpiness.\nExamples:\n\nWhen you enter a bar, they check your ID and see your full name, date of birth, and address. But they only need to know that you are older than the legal age in your country! Technically, they don’t even need to know your exact birthday.\nIf you set up a home security system, the camera does not just record intruders but also every passing person and car, 24/7, 365 days a year. You have to hope that the majority of such video records are not misused.\nIn medical research, researchers usually only care about high-level correlations and don’t care about information from individual patients. But it is difficult to conduct research without being in the position to learn something about the individual patients.\n\nThe Other Side of the Coin: Alternatively, information that could be unbundled is not unbundled because the person in authority does not want it. For instance, is the CIA acting according to regulations and conventions in their clandestine operations overseas? The CIA can refuse such inquiries and state that they cannot unbundle information due to national security reasons.\nTakeaway: The bundling problem is a key issue for data governance. It is important for designing information flow for accountability.\nThe Recursive Enforcement Problem\nDefinition of The Recursive Enforcement Problem: When reinforcing data privacy regulations or accountability, we often end up in a never-ending recursive loop, where each authority that supervises other entities must themselves be supervised by an authority.\nExample: If you are worried about an organization, like a PhD at a university that uses medical data to do research, you could ask a 3rd party authority to supervise (such as the PhD’s supervisor). But how would the supervisor actually detect that the PhD misuses the data? The data is on the PhD’s computer and they can do anything about it. For the supervisor to detect the misuse, the data must be on the supervisor’s machine and not the student’s. But this becomes very inconvenient for the student. Now, who’s watching the supervisor? We still need to monitor the supervisor to be watched. Then the university, but who monitors the university? This is the recursive enforcement problem.\nQuestion: Who makes sure that nobody is misusing data?\nTakeaway: This is also a core problem challenging data governance. Authority without authority is hard to solve when it comes to data because data must live on a single machine. But in the next lesson, we will discover how age-old political science ideas can help us solve this problem.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/series/privacy_ai_course_notes/course-1-lesson-3-summary/","title":"Course 1 Lesson 3: Summary - Limitations of Information Flows"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/series/privacy_ai_course_notes/course-1-lesson-4-summary/":{"body":"This post is a summary of Course 1, Lesson 4 of OpenMined's new private AI series, Our Privacy Opportunity and covers topics on structured transparency, including input/output privacy, input/output verification, and flow governance.\n\n\nFor a Google Doc version of the summary, click here. Feel free to comment in the Gdoc to help improve the summary notes.\n\nThis lesson focuses on solutions.\nIntroducing Structured Transparency\nDefinition of Structured Transparency: The goal to enable desired uses of transparency without enabling misuse. Gain the benefits of transparency in a structured approach.\nExamples:\n\nSecret ballots are a form of structured transparency: Allowing citizens to vote for their political beliefs without being subjected to shaming or verbal/physical assaults.\nSniffer dogs alerts about contrabands such as drugs and bombs without announcing what else is in the luggage.\nResearchers trying to detect genuine nuclear warheads drew inspiration from progress made in cryptography (transfer of knowledge across disciplines).\n\nImportance of Solving Structured Transparency:\n\nThere has never been a greater need for structured transparency. The rise of digital technology allowed the collection of analysis of sensitive information at an unprecedented scale. It presents an enormous threat to privacy and social stability.\nThere has never been a more promising time to solve structured transparency thanks to techniques that are being created, developed, and improved. But this requires cross-disciplinary knowledge synergy.\n\n5 Components of Structured Transparency\nComponents:\n\nInput privacy\nOutput privacy\nInput verification\nOutput verification\nFlow governance\n\nInput privacy &amp; input verification are guarantees for the input information flow. Output privacy &amp; output verification are guarantees for the output information flow.\nInput privacy and output privacy are guarelates referring to information in the flow that must be hidden. Input verification and output verification refers to information that should be revealed in a verifiable manner.\nFlow governance is about who can change the flow as well as who is allowed to modify the input/output privacy and verification guarantees.\nFocus on the goal rather than the technique for implementing the guarantees.\nInput Privacy\nDefinition: A guarantee involving one or more people so that they can participate in a computation in such a way that none of the parties can know anything about any other party’s input to the computation, intermediate variables, or outputs other than the output specifically designed for them.\nExamples:\n\nYou write a letter, seal the envelope, give it to the post office. The post does not need to know what you wrote in the letter to deliver it to its recipient. The input privacy here is that the mailman won’t be able to see your input in the process of facilitating your information flow.\nSpecial case: If your letter is addressed to the mailman’s mother and, upon receiving the letter, she reads the letter aloud to the mailman, does the mailman violate input privacy? No. Input privacy only counts if the information flow is in process.\n\nTakeaway: Input privacy only guarantees protection of the input through the information flow and the intermediate variables in the information flow, but not the outputs. Nor does it matter if the mailman saw you writing the letter before sealing the envelope.\nImportant: Input privacy is the pipe that does not leak. If the water you pour into the pipe leads back out to you, it does violate input privacy and only means that the flow is designed to output to you as a recipient.\nIf input privacy is satisfied, both the copy problem and the bundling problem can be solved.\nTool 1: Public Key Cryptography\nDefinition: A branch of cryptography allowing a piece of information to be encrypted and decrypted using a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. It’s a straight one-way pipe to the recipient. Your private key only protects information sent to you.\nExample: In secure messaging, you generate a public and a private key. The private key is never shared with anyone but the public key is broadcasted to anyone you want. Your public key encrypts messages in a way that only your private key can decrypt. Therefore, no matter who intercepts the message, only you can decrypt the message.\nTool 2: Homomorphic Encryption (HE) for Input Privacy\nDefinition: A magical tool (a set of algorithms) for 3rd parties to perform computation on encrypted data, without decrypting the data or knowing what actual information is in the data. This means you can delegate others to compute on your encrypted data in a secure approach without them gaining any unintended knowledge of you.\nImportant: The output of a homomorphically encrypted data will always be encrypted with the same key as the input data. HE allows service providers to give their users a guarantee of privacy so that the users truly stay in control of their own information.\nImagine a bank allows you to store your money encrypted by HE. The bank would not know how much money you have, but you can still withdraw or deposit money as normal, knowing how much money you have.\nHE is very general-purpose: multiple parties can use some information encrypted with a public key and run various computation and programs on the encrypted data. The encrypted output of all these operations can only be decrypted by who has the corresponding private key. We can also store information in HE-encrypted manner, waiting for computation later on.\nQuestion: What could you never do that was too risky? That’s where you can use HE.\nTool 3: Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) for Input Privacy\nDefinition: SMPC defines any algorithm where multiple parties can calculate the output of a function while keeping their inputs secret from each other. It’s a formal group of algorithms that satisfy input privacy.\nAdditive Secret Sharing: One of the most interesting SMPC algorithms. It allows multiple people to share ownership of a number and solves the copy problem.\nExample: Take a number 5 and split it randomly into -1 and 6 to give to Bob and Alice. The numbers add up to 5, but each number on its own does not reveal information about number 5. The relationship between the two numbers, however, stores the information of 5. Unless you have both shares, you will not know more about the number. The copy problem is solved because neither Bob nor Alice knows the number they store means 5. It requires 100% consensus among the shareholders to decrypt the information. It’s a shared control over number 5. But both Bob and Alice can perform meaningful computation on the numbers they hold on behalf of the actual number 5. Since everything can be boiled down to numbers, files, videos, and more can be encrypted in this approach.\nNuances for HE and SMPC: HE and SMPC excel in different contexts. SMPC puts a huge load on the network among shareholders but requires low computational resources for each computer. HE does not require high network computation but must do a lot of computational steps to keep the data secure. If you have low internet speed and a powerful computer, HE shines. If you have high internet bandwidth but less powerful computers, SMPC shines.\nOutput Privacy\nDefinition: If there exists an information flow with input and output, how much insight can someone gain on the input by reverse engineering from the output. Even an information flow that perfectly satisfies input privacy can leak insights of its content since input privacy only protects the pipe that sends the information, not before or after.\nOutput privacy ensures that certain attributes of the input information do not leak from reverse engineering of the output. It is chiefly concerned with the bundling problem, conveying exactly and only what the central message is without revealing additional information.\nDifferential Privacy\nDefinition: Differential privacy provides output privacy in a very specific context: aggregate statistics over a large group of people. DP makes it possible to disentangle learning about the population as a whole from learning idiosyncratic information about individuals in the population.\nExample:\n\nSuppose Andrew wants to know about the average age of all students participating in Course 1. A privacy-intrusive way is to ask everyone to type in their age. Andrew does not need to know each person’s age to get the information.\nEven if we use HE to provide input privacy, Andrew could still find ways to reverse engineer. Suppose Andrew learned that there are 1000 students in the course and the average age is 27. Now, Andrew excludes you from the email and asks the other 999 students to re-submit their age. Assume the new average age of the other 999 students is 27.007. Oh, now Andrew knows you are around 20 years old (1000 * 27 - 999 * 27.007 20).\nAlternatively, Andrew could pretend to be the other 999 students and asks you to give him your encrypted age. The end result is the same: Andrew can reverse engineer and obtain information about you.\nNow, with DP, what if you get to pick a random number from -100 to 100 to add to your age first before encrypting it and sending it to Andrew? So say you are 30 and add -50 before sending -20 to Andrew. That makes no sense? But interestingly, if you have good randomness, then the average of the random numbers people choose will approach 0. A few random numbers can be noisy, but infinite choices between -100 and 100 cancels out the noise.\nAndrew now can average over all the “ages” of the class to get close enough to the true average age of the class, but he has no way to reverse engineer anymore. So maybe Andrew knows you submitted -4, but...he learned nothing about your true age since you could have picked any numbers from -100 to 100.\n\nRobust Output Privacy Infrastructure\nEpsilon (ε): Measurement in differential privacy. The more randomness people add to their data, the better the privacy protection is. So we need to be able to measure a strong versus a weak privacy protection. For instance, the range of (-100, 100) is better than the range of (0, 1).\nPrivacy Budget: A hospital with 3,000 patients wants to let researchers use patient data to cure cancer. How does the hospital ensure that no researcher could reverse engineer the output they get from a ML model back to individual medical records that served as input? By giving each researcher something called a privacy budget.\nImportant:\n\nPrivacy budget is a measure that ensures that all the results a researcher generates from the input data must, when taken together, represent less than  X ε of information. X is a measure of your maximum tolerance for information reconstruction risk. If you are not too worried about someone trying to reconstruct your data, you could set X to 100; but if you are really worried, you could set it to 1 or 0.1. It does not matter what specific algorithms the researcher uses as long as it can be measured by ε, you get a formal guarantee that by the probability that a researcher can reconstruct your data from the statistical results.\nWe just mentioned that every researcher gets their own ε. Suppose there are 10 researchers and each of them receives 20 ε of privacy budget, does that add up to 200 ε? What if the researchers pool their results together? In theory, if they combine the results in the right way, they could achieve as much information leakage. If this is a concern, you should track a global ε against all researchers who work with your dataset. But if you are not worried about researchers pooling results together, then an individual basis for privacy budget should be fine.\nNow, think from the perspective of a patient. How does ε apply to you? If you are a patient at 2 hospitals and both hospitals allow researchers to use data about you? If each hospital allocates 20 of information about you, then there could be 40 information about you leaked out! Just because your hospital doesn’t think they leak private information about you does not mean they don’t actually leak it.\n\nExample: Netflix used to run the biggest anonymized dataset for machine learning competition. They replaced movie titles and usernames with random numbers. So Netflix thought user privacy should not be a problem. Well...if only IMDb did not exist. IMDb also keeps a big list of movies and a list of users. Sometimes people post their ratings about a movie on IMDb while posting ratings about the same movies on Netflix. So Netflix released some ε of information about its anonymized users. IMDb leaks a lot of ε about some overlapping users. So much ε is in the public that some researchers could successfully launch a deanonymization attack.\nQuestion: How much ε should we care about? Transform ε by calculating β = e ^ ε. If a medical study guarantees no more than 2β will be released. If β is 2, pick any event in the future (your partner leaving you, your insurance premium raised, etc.) and β guarantees that if you participate in this medical study, the probability of that event going up is 2x current probability. From the perspective of DP, the guarantee does not care whether the event seems related. So the probability of an event happening after you participated in this medical study will be no greater than β times the current probability.\nTakeaway: is our protection, a formal upper bound of bad things that can happen to you in a statistical analysis (surveys, usage on Chrome, Firefox, texting apps, or health monitoring apps, etc.).\nInput Verification\nNow you may wonder, with all the input &amp; output privacy techniques in place, if I’m doing data science and cannot look at the data, how do I know I’m training on data that I’m supposed to train on!? How do I know if the information is good or true?\nDefinition: Input verification is about verifying specific attributes of input to an information flow.\nInternal Consistency: refers to when someone in the real world can recognize how things are usually constructed and laid out. Internal consistency is what people look for when they examine for fake-ness. It’s one of the most powerful tools for communicating trust.\nProblems: Use internal consistency to verify the authenticity of an information flow output has 2 major problems:\n\nWith enough effort, internal consistency can be faked (e.g. dollar bills can be faked, DeepFake can fake images, videos and audios).\nIt requires sending more information than is required for communication. It necessitates information leakage!\n\nTools: HTTPS\nQuestion 1: What tools exist that can allow us to verify a piece of information that ideally can’t be faked and does not require revealing other information in the process?\nExamples:\n\nThe internet is one of the most powerful input verification technologies deployed. You asked the internet for a URL and servers around the world help you find the correct server to render the website for the URL. “A man in the middle attack” is a hack that disrupts such input verification. It takes one person in the middle of the chain to change the message you send and receive back, especially for the internet.\nThe little lock in your URL field indicates that you loaded your webpage using HTTPS, which represents the most important tool for input verification: cryptographic signature, a kind of signature that solves input verification.\n\nCryptographic Signature: Remember public &amp; private keys? You create a pair of public and private keys and you broadcast the public key to the entire world so that they can send you messages. But we hide our private keys because our private keys allow us to sign a signature in a way that no other key could do and only our public key can verify. As long as the recipient holds your public key and your signature, they know it’s from you.\nQuestion 2: What does the signature mean? Just a mark attached to an object that is affiliated to us that only we can mark. Unlike real-world signatures, digital signatures are sent in a separate file that is called a certificate.\nQuestion 3: So back to the original topic, how do I know that webpage content coming back from all the passing hands of servers is the actual site I typed into my URL field? Every signature is on a certificate registry on the web. The signature attached to this webpage content can be verified against the signature in the certificate registry. So only the owner of this webpage content can sign the signature, not the “man in the middle”.\nQuestion 4: But can’t someone just find out the signature in the certificate registry and copy it!? Well...signatures are protected by hash. Hash is a big, deterministic number. Given two inputs that are the same, the hashes are the same. But two the inputs vary just slightly, the resulting hashes won’t be the same. So when the original server signs a webpage before sending it to you, it hashes the whole webpage into a single number and creates a signature for that number so that signature is unique to that webpage. No one could use that signature for anything else. If a “man in the middle” changes a single character in the webpage content, the signed hash wouldn’t match the page so the signature wouldn’t match.\nNOTE: This video really helps if any of the notes above is complicated.\nTools: Active Security &amp; Zero Knowledge Proofs\nNow we know there are tools that ensure input verification in the information flow, but can we somehow perform computation on the input along the pipeline and still maintain the verifiability of the input without corrupting it?\nYes, two approaches can fix this issue, verifying a flow and its input:\n\nZero-Knowledge Proofs.\nEncrypted computation (e.g. homomorphic encryption, etc.) with Active Security.\n\nIf a computation is agreed upon, then a signature can be created when the information within an information flow is processed such that there is cryptographic evidence allowing everyone who participated in the computation that their involvement is included in the output. This approach can be used for machine learning or voting or other activities.\nImportant Points:\n\nA public/private key pair doesn’t have to be tied to an exact identity. It could be tied to your anonymous identity. Others don’t need to know who you are or what your gender is or what your name is. They just need to know that you are that random person who is consistently signing with that key pair. The key pair can even represent a group of people, not just you. So you can identify as a member of a group without disclosing your exact identity.\nYou can have an infinite number of public/private key pairs. If you wish that not everyone can tie you down to an exact key pair, you can use multiple key pairs to communicate with different people.\n\nReputation:\nIf you are a data scientist and you are connected to 365 data owners who claim to have access to breast cancer data. Since the data is private, you cannot peek into it. They all charge you $10/day to train ML models on their data.\nQuestion: How do you know which of the data from the 365 data owners to train on?\nFirst, some of them might already be entities, such as well-known hospitals, that you know and trust. What about the other data owners? If you are the very first person to work with this strange data owner, you won’t know. You have to be the first to try it. If you trained on this data and evaluated the model on another well-known dataset, then the data probably worked and you can leave a review for this data owner, proofing that you did the analysis with a signature. Now the world has someone who left cryptographic evidence that they evaluated the data from this data owner.\nA second person came along and saw your review and they tried, leaving a review. Then the third came along, and the fourth. They all signed that this dataset, which we cannot see, is good.\n[Note: this bit is a bit hard to take notes on] All that you had to go on is a bunch of anonymous reviews on a secret dataset. Since you cannot invent trust out of nowhere. You can take a tiny bit of trust, try it, review it, and scale this trust to the whole community.\nOutput Verification\nDefinition: The guarantee that output from a hidden information flow (with hidden input transformation) contains the properties that we want. It is one of the most important components of structured transparency because it enables us to verify that an algorithm is desirable.\nExamples:\nDL models might be biased or unfair because of the intrinsic bias built into the datasets they are trained on. There are ethical concerns about these models. Therefore, we should develop techniques to assess the model outputs for bias or unfairness.\nQuestion: If all the decisions in the world are made by humans by hand, do we know whether any particular decision is made in a fair way?\nIf there’s a procedure being followed, we could evaluate the procedure. But if the person made it based on gut feelings, then we enter a slippery slope. To truly know the mind of a person who made a decision is close to impossible.\nA Formal Set of Procedures: So it is quite clear to us that human brains, similar to ML models, are blackboxes. We have procedures for what people can or cannot do and use procedures to ensure that their decisions are fair and just. This brings the decision and the decision-making process out in the open.\nTakeaway: Law is a formal set of procedures. An algorithm is a formal set of procedures. Algorithms, with the right output verification technique, can become vastly more transparent than human brains. Algorithms might not be ready for all cases, but they present a long-term potential to help society to become more transparent. It is, after all, easier to audit an algorithm than the human mind.\nFlow Governance\nQuestion: If an information flow that achieves input privacy is set up, who has the ability to turn the input privacy guarantee off? Same for output privacy, input/output verification.\nDefinition: Without proper flow governance, the integrity of the other 4 guarantees can be entirely at risk.\nExamples:\n\nPublic key: If Andrew sends Nahua a message, Andrew would use Nahua’s public key to encrypt the message. The content of this message is now governed by Nahua, who holds the secret key to decrypt the message. Other people can steal or store the message but the content of the message can only be used by Nahua. This is unilateral governance. One key holder, one person that controls the data.\nHomomorphic Encryption: If someone hands you a bit of information encrypted with their public key, you have some governance over the data: You can compute over the encrypted information and transform it. You cannot act on it in the real world but you still have some more power than if it were encrypted by public keys. The decryption still belongs to the person holding the private key. Governance to act on a piece of information in the real world lies with the one entity that holds the private key.\nIn Secure Multi-Party Computation, we have consensus governance: Only when all parties agree on some computation, would the computation be allowed. Each shareholder has veto power to stop an information flow from happening.\nWhat about a governance of democratic majority? This is called threshold schemes. You can set an arbitrary percentage so if enough shareholders agree, they have enough cryptographic permission to perform some computation. Groups of people, given checks and balances, are possible to work together towards a shared goal.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/series/privacy_ai_course_notes/course-1-lesson-4-summary/","title":"Course 1 Lesson 4: Summary - Structured Transparency"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":25,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/":{"body":0,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/my-path-to-programming/":{"body":2093,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/open-source-walk-through-with-rust-seaorm/":{"body":2206,"title":6},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/series/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/series/privacy_ai_course_notes/":{"body":0,"title":5},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/series/privacy_ai_course_notes/course-1-lesson-2-summary/":{"body":2029,"title":9},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/series/privacy_ai_course_notes/course-1-lesson-3-summary/":{"body":439,"title":8},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/series/privacy_ai_course_notes/course-1-lesson-4-summary/":{"body":2147,"title":7}},"length":9},"lang":"English"};
